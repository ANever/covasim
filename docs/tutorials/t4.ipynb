    "\n",
    "Covasim includes pre-downloaded data on country (and US state) age distributions and household size distributions. As we saw in Tutorial 1, you can load these data simply by using the `location` parameter. You can show a list of all available locations with `cv.data.show_locations()`. The data themselves are simply a set of dictionaries, and thiese can be modified directly; for example, to add a custom age distribution for Johannesburg would look like this:\n",

While other columns can be included and will be loaded, they won't be parsed by Covasim.
