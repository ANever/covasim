    "A few things to note here:\n",
    "* By default, interventions are shown with vertical dashed lines. You can turn this off by passing `do_plot=False` to the intervention.\n",
    "* Look at the new infections plot (middle) for the clearest illustration of the impact the intervention has.\n",
    "* Note that like other \"parameters\", you can either pass interventions to the sim directly or as part of the pars dictionary; the exmaples below illustrate these options.\n",
    "* All interventions handle dates automatically, so days can be specified as strings, integer numbers of days from the start of the sim, or datetime objects. You can even mix and match (e.g. `days=[10, '2020-05-05']`), although this is not recommended for obvious reasons!\n",
    "\n",
    "If your simulation has different layers (discussed in Tutorial 1), you can also define the beta change to only apply to a single layer. For example, an intervention that closed 90% of schools (`'s'`) on September 1st would be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "close_schools = cv.change_beta(days='2020-09-01', changes=0.1, layers='s')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"clip edges\" intervention works similarly to the \"change beta\" intervention, with two important distinctions:\n",
    "1. Whereas beta changes affect the per-contact transmission probability, clip edges change the number of contacts. For example, in the `close_schools` example above, each school-aged child has an uncanged number of contacts (about 20), but 10 times lower probability of infection per contact (about 0.1% per contact per day). If clip edges were used instead, then each child would have unchanged probability of infection per contact (about 1% per contact per day), but 10 times fewer contacts (about 2).\n",
    "2. While beta changes can be any value (greater or less than 1), as the name implies, clip edges can only *clip* edges, not create new ones. Edges that are clipped are saved and can later be restored, but you can never have a change of greater than 1.0 with clip edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n",
    "    Overall, it's best to use <code>change_beta</code> for interventions that reduce per-contact risk (e.g., masks), and <code>clip_edges</code> for interventions that reduce the number of contacts per person. However, in practice, it tends to make relatively little difference to the simulation results. If in doubt, use <code>change_beta</code>.\n",

    "## Testing interventions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of testing interventions in Covasim:\n",
    "1. `test_num` performs the specified *number* of tests per day;\n",
    "2. `test_prob` performs testing with the specified *probability*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, if you have actual data on number of tests, you would use `test_num`; otherwise, you would usually use `test_prob`. For `test_num`, other than the number of tests performed, the main parameter is `symp_prob`, which determines how much more likely someone with (true positive) COVID symptoms is to test than a person who is asymptomatic or uninfected. Higher values of `symp_prob` give more diagnoses per number of tests, since symptomatic people preferentially test. The default value is 100, meaning that on any given day, a person experiencing COVID symptoms is 100 times more likely to test than someone who isn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, `test_prob` also lets you specify the (daily) probability of symptomatic vs. asymptomatic testing. Unlike `test_num`, however, the total number of tests is determined by these probabilities. For example, since symptomatic testing probabilities are usually much higher than asymptomatic, if the epidemic is growing, more people will be symptomatic and thus go to be tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n",
    "    Note that test probabilities for <code>test_prob</code> are daily probabilities, not total. If you set <code>symp_prob = 0.3</code>, this means a person has a 30% chance of testing <i>per day of symptoms</i>, meaning that on average they will go to be tested after 2-3 days. Given that symptoms last for up to 8 days, the total probability that they will test at some point during their illness is much higher than the daily probability.\n",
    "</div>\n",
