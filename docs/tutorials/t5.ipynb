    "- **`__init__()`** just does what init always does; it's needed to create the class instance. For interentions, it's usually used to store keyword arguments and perform some basic initialization (the first two lines).\n",
    "- **initialize()** is similar to init, with the difference that it's invoked when the *sim* itself is initialized. It receives the sim as an input argument. This means you can use it to do a fairly powerful things. Here, since `sim.people` already exists, we can calculate up-front who the elderly are so we don't have to do it on every timestep.\n",
    "- **apply()** is the crux of the intervention. It's run on every timestep of the model, and also receives `sim` as an input. You almost always use `sim.t` to get the current timestep, here to turn the intervention on and off. But as this example shows, its real power is that it can make direct modifications to the sim itself (`sim.people.rel_sus[self.elderly] = self.rel_sus`). It can also perform calculations and store data in itself, as shown here with `self.exposed` (although in general, analyzers are better for this, since they happen at the end of the timestep, while interventions happen in the middle).\n",
    "- **plot()** is a custom method that shows a plot of the data gathered during the sim. Again, it's usually better to use analyzers for this, but for something simple like this it's fine to double-dip and use an intervention.\n",
