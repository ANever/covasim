    "\n",
    "Agents in the simulation interact with each other via one or more *contact layers*. You can think of each agent as a node in a mathematical graph, and each connection as an edge. By default, Covasim creates a single random contact network where each agent is connected to 20 other agents, completely at random. However, this is not a very realistic representation of households, workplaces, schools, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For greater realism, Covasim also comes with a \"hybrid\" population option, which provides a more realism while still being fast to generate. (It's called \"hybrid\" because it's a combination of the random network and the SynthPops network, described in Tutorial 9, which is much more realistic but requires a lot of data and is computationally intensive.) The hybrid option provides four *contact layers*: households (`'h'`), schools (`'s'`), workplaces (`'w'`), and community interactions (`'c'`). Each layer is defined by (a) which agents are connected to which other agents, and (b) the weight of each connection (i.e., transmission probability). Specifically:\n",
    "* Households are small clusters, usually 2-5 people (depending on country), consisting of a wide variety of ages; this setting has high transmission probability\n",
    "* Schools are split into classrooms, usually about 20 students each, of students aged 6–22; this setting has medium transmission probability\n",
    "* Workplaces are clusters of about 5-20 people, aged (approximately) 22-65; this setting has medium transmission probability\n",
    "* Community contacts (representing parks, restaurants, transport, places of worship, etc.) are estimated as 20 random contacts per day; this setting has low transmission probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for most countries, you can load default data (age distribution and household size, both from the UN) by using the `location` keyword when creating a sim. For example, to create a realistic (i.e. hybrid) population 10,000 people for Bangladesh and plot the results, you would do:"
